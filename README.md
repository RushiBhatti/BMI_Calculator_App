# BMI Calculator App
This is my first Flutter project.

- Users can input their height and weight and see their Body Mass Index as a result.
- App also shows a message to the user according to input, if input parameters are not valid then app shows that 'Please, enter valid parameters!'.

**Output video and screenshots are given below.**
